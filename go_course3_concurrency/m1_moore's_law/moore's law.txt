Moore's Law
"Transistor density would double every two years."

Problems:
- Norman Bottleneck
    Memory has high latency.
- Power/temperature problem
    Increased amount of transistors leads to increased power consumption and therefore higher templerature.
- Dynamic power
    Power consumption is increasing with 
        higher clock-frequency
        high distance voltage swing (lower distance voltage swing reduces power consumption)
        smaller transistors switching faster
- Dennard Scaling 
    Power leakage isn't considered.
    Voltage must stay above a threshold. It can't be scaled to low.
    Noise problems occur.
- Multi-core
    To improve performance with a constant capacity of a single core.
